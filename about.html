    <p>
      I’m Strategy Director at LiveXtension and a lecturer at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, where I contribute to exploring the connections between digital innovation, sustainability, and the role of technology in enhancing well-being. Over the past decade, I’ve guided branding and communication strategies that merge creativity and data to achieve lasting, positive impact.

      Fascinated by the interplay between the human mind and technology, I delve into how artificial intelligence can refine marketing and enrich our lives. In my free time, I write and share thoughts on the future of innovation and sustainability, always driven by the belief in the transformative power of ideas and authentic collaboration.
